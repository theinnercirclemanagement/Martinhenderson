    <p>
      I never set out to be in front of the camera.
    </p>
    <p>
      I grew up in New Zealand — a place where the land speaks louder than people.  
      There’s a quiet there. A rhythm.  
      I carry that with me.
    </p>
    <p>
      Acting found me more than I found it.  
      I started on a soap opera in Auckland, not because I dreamed of fame,  
      but because I loved the story — and the chance to step into someone else’s skin.
    </p>
    <p>
      From there, I moved to Australia, then to the U.S.,  
      playing characters who were often broken, searching, trying to do better —  
      Jack in <em>Virgin River</em>, Nathan in <em>Grey’s Anatomy</em>,  
      men shaped by loss, love, and second chances.
    </p>
    <p>
      Over the years, fans have reached out — not just about the shows,  
      but about how the stories made them feel.  
      How Jack’s journey helped them through grief.  
      How a line I spoke out loud gave them courage to say it themselves.
    </p>
    <p>
      That’s stayed with me.
    </p>
    <p>
      This space isn’t about promotion.  
      It’s about presence.  
      A place to share the moments behind the scenes —  
      not the polished ones, but the real ones.
    </p>
    <p>
      The quiet mornings on set.  
      The music that gets me through the day.  
      The thoughts I don’t post online.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you’ve followed this path with me — thank you.  
      This is for you.
    </p>
