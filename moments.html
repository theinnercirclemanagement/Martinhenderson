    <h2>A Morning in Virgin River</h2>
    <p class="date">June 10, 2025</p>
    <p>
      Woke up before dawn today. The set was quiet — just the sound of the river and birds.
    </p>
    <p>
      I sat on the porch of Jack’s cabin with a coffee, wearing his jacket, thinking about where he’s been.
      Season 7 is digging deeper into his past — not just the military, but what it means to come home.
    </p>
    <p>
      The crew wasn’t filming yet. Just me, the mist, and the trees.
    </p>
    <div class="highlight">
      I recorded a short voice note this morning. It’s attached below — just the sounds of the river and a few thoughts. 
      Nothing polished. Just real.

    <h2>Music That Moves Me</h2>
    <p class="date">May 28, 2025</p>
    <p>
      People know Jack loves classic rock — but off-screen, my playlist is quieter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lately, I’ve been listening to Nick Drake, Bill Callahan, and some old Neil Young.  
      Music that doesn’t demand attention — just sits with you.
    </p>
    <p>
      I’ve put together a small playlist of songs that have meant something to me over the years.  
      Nothing fancy — just 12 tracks that got me through long drives, tough days, or quiet nights.
    </p>
    <div class="highlight">
      Members get access to the full playlist (Spotify link or downloadable audio notes).

    <h2>Behind the Scenes: The Bar</h2>
    <p class="date">May 3, 2025</p>
    <p>
      We filmed a big scene at Jack’s bar last week — one that brings back someone from his past.
    </p>
    <p>
      The set is always alive — even when the cameras aren’t rolling.  
      There’s a warmth there, like the place is real.
    </p>
    <div class="highlight">
      I took a few photos between takes — the empty stools, the lights, the quiet before the storm.  
      They’re not on Instagram. They’re here.
